<!-- Tips -->
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p><b>Type of cup noodle:</b><br> The most popular noodle used is Shinramen, but you can choose your own noodle depending on your tolerance to spice and personal preference.</p>
        <p><b>Adding Protein:</b><br> Feel free to add some protein of your choice. If you are going to use Spam, I personally recommend Lite Spam so that the fried rice does not get too salty.</p>
        <p><b>Rice:</b><br> Cold day-old rice works best for fried rice since it absorbs liquid more easily then freshly cooked rice.<br>Avoid sweet, sushi, or glutinous rice as they become stickier and clump.</p>

        <h2>Recipe Webstie Review</h2>
            <p> <a href="https://doobydobap.com/recipe/ramen-fried-rice">Doobydobap</a> This personal recipe blog not only has step by step instructions, but also photos that correspond to each step, making the content easier to understand than the contents only with written instructions. Another element I like is the summarized table of ingredients and instructions. The list of ingredients are interactive check boxes that cross out when selected. I want to incorporate embed this feature in my recipe website so that the contents are usable.</p>

            <p><a href="https://pinchofyum.com/">Pinch of Yum</a> I was attracted to the way the contents are arranged. Although there's no unique style of arrangement that particularily stands out, the website is easy to navigate and straightforward. I also like how the recipes are categorized to help users search for their desired recipe more easily.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eateryberlin.com/de">Eatery Berlin</a> I was drawn to stylish elements in this recipe website. It actively utilizes visual imagery and vivid color to draw interest of viewers. I also personally like the style of cover images of each recipe. The use of high-contrast background color for the food harmonizes with the overall colorscheme of the website, and helps the food photographs stand out among vivid website. </p>

        <h2>None-recipe Website Review</h2>
            <p> <a href="https://general-store.org/">General Store</a> Although I think the text needs more hierarchy and organization, I appreciate the interaction that happens as the user scrolls through the website. This turns the site navigation into an intriguing experience. I also like the aesthetics of the product detail page, which is characterized by vivid color and images with background removed.</p>

            <p> <a href="https://magicstoneware.com/">Magic Stoneware</a> This is a website format I want to adopt for my recipe page, because I am personally drawn to the grid arrangement. I also like how simple and impactful the heading of the website is, whith black bold sans-serif typeface. In addition, I think the way product description is arranged as a table works well in keeping information simple and succinct.</p>

            <p> <a href="https://carolinafeijo.cargo.site/Holding-Moving-Touching-and-Feeling-things-Hands-Photobook-copy">Carolina Feijó</a> I feel like the text in this website is too small that it is not easy to read. However, I like the division of the screen in which the left part shows table of contents, and the right part shows relevant images of the selected content. I also like how the table of content is fixed, while the images scroll.</p>
