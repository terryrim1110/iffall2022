        <p>2. I have been mainly working on paintings, but I suddenly got interested in UI/UX Design this summer. I know nothing about html/css, so I wanted to get introduced to these through this class!</p>

        <p>4. I hope to learn about creating interactive elements.</p>
        <p>5. I think designing for screen is easier to edit when it comes to making mistakes</p>

        <p>7. <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.kr"> Pinterest </a> It was easy for me to navigate when I first started using it.</p>
