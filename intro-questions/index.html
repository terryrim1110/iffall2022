        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Terry Rim, senior majoring in fine arts.</p>
        <p>2. I have been mainly working on paintings, but I suddenly got interested in UI/UX Design this summer. I know nothing about html/css, so I wanted to get introduced to these through this class!</p>
        <p>3. I have absolutely no experience with html/css/js.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn about creating interactive elements.</p>
        <p>5. I think designing for screen is easier to edit when it comes to making mistakes</p>
        <p>6. https://simplychocolatecph.com/ I was amazed by the level of interaction in a one-scroll website.</p>
        <p>7. https://www.pinterest.co.kr/ It was easy for me to navigate when I first started using it.</p>
        <p>8. https://unitedsodas.com/ I like this website because it is easy to navigate, simple yet intriguing. It never makes me bored to scroll down.</p>
