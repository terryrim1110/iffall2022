                <h3>Earliest physical evidence, ~200 BC</h3>

                <p>Tea was discovered in the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han in Xi'an in 2016, indicating that tea from the genus Camellia was drunk by Han dynasty emperors</p>

                <h3>Introduction to Europe, ~1500s</h3>

                <p>Tea was first introduced to Western priests and merchants in China during the16th century. The earliest European reference to tea came from the writing of a Venetian in 1545.</p>

                <h3>Introduction to India, ~1800s</h3>

                <p>Chinese small-leaf-type tea was brought to India in 1836 by the British. In 1841, seeds of Chinese tea from the Kumaun region were brought to Darjeeling, and Darjeeling tea began to be produced in 1856.</p>

                <h3>Modern-day</h3>

                <p>Tea is now enjoyed by those all over the world, with China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and many other countries having their own tea culture and variations on the preparation of the drink.</p>
