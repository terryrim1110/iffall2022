                <h3>China</h3>

                <p>Chinese tea culture includes all facets of tea, both physical and spiritual, that significantly influenced Chinese culture throughout history. Physically, it consists of the history of tea cultivation, brewing, serving techniques, methods of consumption, arts, and the tea ceremony. Tea culture also has non-physical aspects such as symbolic, spiritual, religious, psychological, and social. Tea has been a part of China for over four thousand years and continues to influence the people and nation today. One form of Chinese tea ceremony is the Gongfu tea ceremony, which typically uses small Yixing clay teapots and oolong tea.</p>

                <h3>Japan</h3>

                <p>The Japanese tea ceremony (known as sadō/chadō) is a Japanese cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of matcha, powdered green tea, the procedure of which is called temae. While in the West it is known as "tea ceremony", it is seldom ceremonial in practice. Most often tea is served to family, friends, and associates; religious and ceremonial connotations are overstated in western spaces.</p>

                <h3>The United Kingdom</h3>

                <p>In the United Kingdom, 63% of people drink tea daily. It is customary for a host to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival. Tea is consumed both at home and outside the home, often in cafés or tea rooms. Afternoon tea with cakes on fine porcelain is a cultural stereotype</p>

                <h3>The United States</h3>

                <p>In the United States, 80% of tea is consumed as iced tea.[122] Sweet tea is native to the southeastern U.S. and is iconic in its cuisine.</p>

                <h3>Turkey</h3>

                <p>Turkish tea is an important part of that country's cuisine and is the most commonly consumed hot drink, despite the country's long history of coffee consumption. As of 2013, the per-capita consumption of Turkish tea exceeds 10 cups per day and 13.8 kg per year. Tea is grown mostly in Rize Province on the Black Sea coast.</p>

                <h3>Russia</h3>

                <p>Russia has a long, rich tea history dating to 1638 when tea was introduced to Tsar Michael. Social gatherings were considered incomplete without tea, which was traditionally brewed in a samovar.</p>

                <h3>India</h3>

                <p>Indian tea culture is strong; the drink is the most popular hot beverage in the country. It is consumed daily in almost all houses, offered to guests, consumed in high amounts in domestic and official surroundings, and is made with the addition of milk with or without spices, and usually sweetened.

                <h3>Mali</h3>

                <p>In Mali, gunpowder tea is served in series of three, starting with the highest oxidisation or strongest, unsweetened tea, locally referred to as "strong like death", followed by a second serving, where the same tea leaves are boiled again with some sugar added ("pleasant as life"), and a third one, where the same tea leaves are boiled for the third time with yet more sugar added ("sweet as love").
